                Hello! My name is Kade Busam and I am in the computer science class at Plymouth High School. I have always been 
                interested in Computer Science, and creating websites. I think this could be very useful for me in the future.
                I am planning on creating a business, so knowing how to create my own website will help greatly. I am a Junior
                in highschool, and am planning on going to college. I take many college classes right now in highschool to make
                my college journey a little cheaper and easier. 
             <br> <br>
                
                The whale is my spirit animal. The whale is a symbol of compassion and solitude, and knowledge of both life and death.
                They are also associated with unbridled creativity. The exhalation through the blowhole symbolizes the freeing of one's
                own creative energies. The sound is also a creative force of life. The whale is a symbol for many different things.
                For example, it is also a symbol of growth and progress. 
            </p> <br>
